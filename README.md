# Atmega328Drivers
A personal project with drivers for the ATmega328 microcontroller, including a 4x4 keypad password system using a state machine. This is a work-in-progress and not actively maintained, as Iâ€™m currently focusing on Python and data projects.

## Note
- Originally a solo project, not fully documented.
- Future updates may include better documentation and additional drivers.
